Welcome to the **Employee Salary Prediction** project! This Machine Learning app predicts an employee’s income based on various demographic and professional features. It uses **Gradient Boosting Classifier** and offers model explainability using **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**. The model is deployed via a **Streamlit web application** for interactive usage.
